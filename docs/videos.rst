Here are some short demonstration videos to illustrate some of the features of the Arbor web interface:

OpenTree Integration
--------------------

In the link below, we use Arbor analyses that invoke the OpenTree API.
This integration technique makes it possible to query the OpenTree for taxonomy
lookup and subtree extraction without having to write any program code.
The algorithms performed in the Arbor analyses need to be yet refined to produce
useful phylogenetic results:

LifeMapper Integration
----------------------

Below is a link to preliminary work to request species occurrence points from LifeMapper
in order to examine phylogenetic and species range information together:
